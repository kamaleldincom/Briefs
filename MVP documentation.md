# News Aggregation Platform Documentation

## Project Overview

Our platform reimagines how people consume news by aggregating stories from multiple trusted sources and presenting them in an engaging, modern interface. Instead of reading news from individual sources, users can see how different outlets cover the same story, providing a more complete picture of current events.

## Core Concepts

### Story Aggregation
At the heart of our platform lies the story aggregation system. Rather than treating each news article as a separate entity, we group related articles into unified stories. This approach helps users understand different perspectives on the same event and reduces information redundancy.

Our aggregation system uses content similarity analysis to identify related articles. We compare article titles and content using keyword extraction and similarity scoring. When articles share enough common elements, they are grouped into a single story. This process ensures that users see a comprehensive view of each news event rather than fragmented coverage.

### Source Management
We specifically focus on trusted news sources to ensure quality coverage. Each source is assigned characteristics like bias ratings, which helps provide context about the coverage. By limiting our sources to established news organizations, we maintain content quality while still capturing different perspectives on events.

### Modern Interface
Drawing inspiration from popular social media platforms, we implemented a vertical snap-scrolling interface that makes news consumption more engaging. This design choice makes the platform feel familiar to users while maintaining the seriousness required for news content.

## Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack
We built the platform using modern web technologies:
- Next.js 15.1.2 with App Router for server-side rendering and routing
- TypeScript for type safety and improved development experience
- Tailwind CSS for responsive and maintainable styling
- shadcn/ui for consistent and accessible UI components

### Core Components

#### News Feed System
The feed system employs a vertical snap-scrolling mechanism that presents one story at a time. Each story card contains:
- A prominent headline
- Visual content when available
- Source attribution badges
- Publication timing
- Coverage metrics

We implemented this using CSS scroll snap and careful component organization to ensure smooth performance and proper content delivery.

#### Story Aggregation Engine
The aggregation engine processes incoming articles through several steps:
1. Content normalization removes special characters and standardizes text
2. Keyword extraction identifies important terms
3. Similarity calculation determines article relationships
4. Group formation combines related articles into unified stories
5. Metadata compilation creates comprehensive story objects

#### Story Detail View
The detail view expands on aggregated content by showing:
1. Latest developments with timestamps
2. Different perspectives from various sources
3. Notable statements and quotes
4. Chronological development timeline
5. Source listing with original article links

### Data Architecture

#### Story Type
```typescript
interface Story {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  summary: string;
  content: string;
  sources: Source[];
  metadata: StoryMetadata;
  analysis: StoryAnalysis;
}
```

This structure allows us to combine multiple sources while maintaining individual attribution and chronological development.

#### News Integration
We integrate with NewsAPI to fetch content from trusted sources. The integration:
- Filters for specific trusted sources
- Handles rate limiting
- Processes responses into our internal format
- Manages error cases

## User Experience Design

### Feed Experience
The feed provides a focused, immersive experience where:
- Each story occupies the full viewport
- Smooth transitions guide users between stories
- Visual content is prominently featured
- Source information is easily scannable
- Important metadata is clearly presented

### Detail Experience
The detail view expands on the feed by:
- Providing comprehensive coverage
- Showing chronological development
- Highlighting different perspectives
- Maintaining clear source attribution
- Enabling access to original articles

## Implementation Challenges and Solutions

### Story Matching
Challenge: Identifying related articles without direct references.
Solution: Implemented content similarity analysis using keyword extraction and Jaccard similarity scoring.

### Content Organization
Challenge: Presenting multiple sources coherently.
Solution: Developed a structured story format that maintains individual source contributions while presenting a unified narrative.

### User Interface
Challenge: Balancing information density with usability.
Solution: Created a hierarchy of information presentation, from summary to detail, allowing users to dig deeper as interested.

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Server-side rendering for fast initial load
- Image optimization for visual content
- Efficient DOM updates during scrolling
- Minimal client-side state management

### Scalability
- Modular component architecture
- Clean separation of concerns
- Type-safe data handling
- Efficient data transformation pipelines

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks for missing content
- Clear error states
- Recovery mechanisms
- User-friendly error messages
